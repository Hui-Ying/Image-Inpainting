For our project, we try to apply a pre-existing technique that uses partial convolutions, which can be applied to images that contain irregularly shaped holes. We add our own modifications to the current technique and test it on a data set based off the ICME 2019 Challenge data set. Our results indicate that the technique does work on irregular holes reasonably well.
